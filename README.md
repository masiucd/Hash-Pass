# Password generator

## Description

This is a simple password generator that generates a password based on the user's input. The user can choose the length of the password and whether to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The password is generated randomly and is displayed on the screen. The user can then copy the password to the clipboard by clicking the "Copy to Clipboard" button.

Also the user can hash the passwords using different algorithms like MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512, and SHA3-256.
This is something I need sometimes when building some hobby projects and I thought it would be a good idea to have a simple password generator that I can use whenever I need it.
